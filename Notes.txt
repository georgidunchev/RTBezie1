Quadratic Triangle:
Calculate intersection between planes:
trinagle ABC
Normals N1, N2

AC _|_ N1
BC _|_ N2
D e BC
AD _|_ N2

|AD| = ( N2 dot AB.normalized ) * |AB|
|AC| = |AD| / |N1 cross N2|
N = N1 cross ( N2 cross (-AB.normalized) )
C = A + N * |AC|

Problem, if angle between N1 and AB or N2 and AB is bigger than 90 => additional bezier point is non existent
