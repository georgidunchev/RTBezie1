Intersection AABB works
visualize leafs of KDTree

looks like the separation is not working right
more splits cause more problems


postprocess the rendered image to fill the not rendered images


problematic settings 1: 
k_nMAX_LEVEL_OF_TREE = 4;
k_nMIN_NUMBER_OF_TRIANGLES_TO_SPLIT = 6;
k_nMAX_SPLITS_OF_NODE = 2;
k_nNUMBER_OF_SUBDIVISIONS = 3;



Things to do:

Render biggest bunny
Interface
Load complex structures
Intersect the complex surfaces
Save to file
Move camera
